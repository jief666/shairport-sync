Shairport Sync
=============
This is a fork to propose a migration to C++. The fact that there is few differents backend, few differents dns etc. is really a perfect illustration of a basic object structure.
Only 2 backend are converted, just as a proof of concept.

If you look for a working implementation an doc got to https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync
